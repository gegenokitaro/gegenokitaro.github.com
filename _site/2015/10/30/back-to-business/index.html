            <p>My HDD drive is dying. Bad sectors everywhere. My Arch is doomed. It's been 5 years since I used this old computer of mine, and just recently I upgraded the memory. And now the drive is failing. It's funny how challenging things keep coming. Should I sink the ship or continue to sail into this horrendous ocean?</p>

<p><br>
<br>
<br></p>

<h3>AND MY ANSWER IS FUCK THE SEA</h3>

<h3>FUCK THE OCEAN</h3>

<h3>COME AT ME KRAKEN</h3>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="/img/ritsu_fail.gif" alt="ritsu_fail" />
<br>
<br>
I failed.</p>

<p>My computer simply didn't boot this time. I laughed a little.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter. I still have many resources. It's time to rob some friends for a working HDD. And I actually got one. There's this one old friend of mine who give me his old (hopefully) 320GB portable HDD out of pity (because it's not actually 320GB, just around 290-305GB). It's actually wasn't his, but it's his friend's port. HDD, and he gives it to me, and I cruelly stripped its inside out, plug the sata cable and voila, my old sweetie boots again.</p>

<p>An empty machine box, with the power of 6GB of RAM, Intel i3 procie, old MSI motherboard, and the good ol' GeForce GT220. Decided to put Archlinux again as the operating system, so I installed it one more time. I throw gnome (without its unneeded apps which is bundled in meta-package gnome-extras, like tons of games I never play anyway), google chrome, graphics related apps that I usually use, brand new unity-editor native linux (hype) and of course yaourt, a tool that makes life easier.
<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<h3>Why Archlinux?</h3>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, I think Archlinux isn't for so advanced linux user, actually it's a bit more for normal users who know to install it. There're some myths that I think it's just myths. Here comes, Archlinux Mythbuster.</p>

<p>First, disclaimer, I already stated that you have to know how to install it, then it's Ubuntu without botnet.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><b>Archlinux is for advanced user, you have to know how the system works.</b><br>
False. I still don't know how my system works and I already used it for 5 years. I mean, just install it, install a DE for fuck sake, and it's the same as any other distro but with a nice package manager. For example, I installed gnome and enable the gdm, and everything work out of the box. No kidding.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Bleeding Edge means it's your head that's bleeding from constant banging against wall due to its major breakage in each update.</b><br>
Who started this bullshit, really. The only notable time I reinstalled my Arch is when the dev make a fuss over systemd migration. Until now, I just pacman -Syu'ed everything and it's always fine. If it breaks, it's either a hardware problem like my case or I managed to break it due to my own stupidity. I managed to break Arch in my laptop, but it's because I throw something evil at it, like yaourt -S everything in AUR doesn't matter if it's flagged out of date or can cause major package breaks. Even Ubuntu and Fedora breaks more often and easily.<br>
Words of advice, Install it, don't update it. Fire and Forget.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Systemd means you suck Lenny's dick and you should kill yourself.</b><br>
I don't even. Why it matters? As long as I can browse the web, draw something in my computer, write some documents, watch videos, and listening some musics, what kind of init system doesn't really matter to me. Bring your init war somewhere else.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Enjoy your black tty life.</b><br>
See point 1 and the disclaimer.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Installing bloat in Archlinux defeat the purpose of Archlinux itself.</b><br>
What is bloat? define bloat. If bloat means something that can cause more productivity without pretending to be hacker and tinkering or ricing your terminal because that's what cool kids do then I prefer the bloat life.</p></li>
</ol>


<p><br>
<br>
Not really a mythbuster, but I think that should do it.
<br>
<br>
A little trip to my freshly installed Gnome-powered Archlinux. I use Google Chrome instead of Firefox, because I need it for LINE desktop. I do not own any smartphone device, but most of my colleague use LINE and WhatsApp as communication tools. Including my girlfriend, so I decided to grab one too. For communication purpose of course.</p>

<p><img src="/img/gnome-arch.png" alt="gnome-arch" /></p>

<p><br>
I rarely play any games, so the only game I own is Stepmania. I love rhythm game and I love how many stepmania communities can provide my favorite song. So, it's my only game installed on this machine box. I didn't even install Steam like I usually do.
<br>
<br></p>

<h3>What's going on?</h3>

<p>This weekend have to be a productive weekend. I have some free time so I plan to continue my delayed icon set, which is near abandoned. By the way, yesterday I accepted the "1 Day 1 (Useless) App Challenge" from my friend, so I ended up making this (useless) app. It's a simple Openbox theme generator, which is built for lazy people. One of my favorite WM is openbox, and I find it almost a pain in the ass to write a theme. Have to write window.title.blabla for most time. So I decided to write an app that can automatically generate openbox theme code. So I can just input the color code or the window type without actually write the theme code.</p>

<p><i>~ But you can edit any existing theme without having to write the syntax</i></p>

<p>Yeah, that's why it's a useless app.</p>

<p>Maybe, in the future, I can rewrite that generator app and make it more interactive. Maybe I can add preview feature or edit on the fly feature. Maybe. It can't be done in 1 Day, for me. So, in the future it is. Maybe.</p>

<p>Here is the (useless) App that I've wrote.</p>

<div id="mini">
<img src="/img/uA-2.png"><img src="/img/uA-3.png">
</div>


<p>It's useless, but I still use it to make a theme for my openbox in my laptop. So even the useless thing somewhat have a meaning.</p>

<p>Like I stated before, this weekend my plan is to revive my old icon set. I'd like to rework it from scratch, remodel all the things, and finally make a good use to it. Many icon themes out there but none of them actually meet my taste, I bet I have to make my own. I'm also working on my small time project for fun which is developing a simple adventure game. I'm still at modelling part, but little by little, I'm sure it will be done. Maybe.</p>

<p>No more heavy desktop-ing for me. Still, I make theme for conky and covergloobus. But not as intensive as old time.</p>
