<p>Well, i’ve been stuck with my final project. Final final project, that means my undergraduate thesis. I’m working with blender for most part. And i’ve not mastered it yet, even though the deadline is drawing near. Argh, i’m stressed out. And when i’m stressed out, my imagination is overflowing.</p>

<p>I’m making this icon theme for refreshing purpose. BUT, i do plan to continue this set so it can be a fully functional icon set. For starter, i’m making the icon set based on GTK+ environment, then i plan to reach Qt as well. Below, is my icon theme preview.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><img src="/img/flat_icon.png" alt="flat icon theme" /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<pre><code>you'll see Yotsuba on them. and Jerry :D
for the mimetypes, it's just a copy paste version from each other. for example, zip and rar, what so different? so i just change the label and keep the archive in the same color and shape.
</code></pre>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Well.. I’m not expecting it to be good, but i’ll give it my best. It’s not my first attempt to create an icon theme, but it sure is the second most exciting thing to do beside tinkering with 3D application. Designing icon/logo is so fun. I enjoy every part of it. I hope i can finish it soon. Not too soon, but soon.</p>

<p>By the way, Gnome 3.16 is already out in the open, and for the most part i love it. After getting shit done and finishing this icon set, i plan to make more serious and well-maintained GTK+ theme. With Gnome stuff theme as well. I’ll read the fucking manual, bit by bit, part by part, so i won’t mess up like i did with my recent Gnome Theme (Kyun, do you know it?). It’s a bit old and may break in the recent version of gnome. And i don’t plan to fix it because i know if i try to do that it will break more than it has. Because it was fucked up. (yeah, i admit that i was drunk when i was working on that one. and i don’t even need alcohol to be drunk. just a couple bottle of soda, and i’ll lose myself in the abyss).</p>

I have a problem collecting application name list since i don’t usually use a lot of applications.</h4>
