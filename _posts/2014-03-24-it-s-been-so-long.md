## Long time no see...

Okay, long time no see. and farewell. bye.

Just kidding, actually i'm working on a small icon set, which i use as my dock icon recently. My icon set, this time, will use .svg file instead some low quality .png which rather comes with disappointment. 
<br>
<br>

<h4 align="center">My Icon Set</h4>

<p align="center"><img style="float: center" src="/img/icon_hand_made.png" /></p>
<br>

Well, i pray that this work will continue. I hope. Somebody wants to help, let me know. How? Maybe through my email at `sol.rizal@gmail.com`. Remember, please follow my icon style if you want to help. or not. Make your own. Carelessly i don't really care. 

	such a good time to work in this manner.
	but i'm working on my 'unimportant project' including some monkey and others thing, so this work, this icon set, will nearly as hopeless as my last cat which is die. 

and with that.. i'm finishing my post.

#### # Screenshit time.. (not a typo, btw)

and this is my screenshot which is contain my icon set, as i use them for my dock. I'm not actively producing desktop screenshot for gahnoo plus linux environment anymore, but i still love simple, beautiful, and work out of the box desktop. And so, this desktop screenshot below isn't suitable for ricing or other submission, it's just my working desktop. On my gentoo machine, which is so unresponsive D:
